1) What is the computational complexity of fact0? Explain your answer. 
def fact0(i):
 assert type(i) == int and i >= 0
 if i == 0 or i == 1:
    return 1
 return i * fact0(i-1) 

Ans: O(n)

2) What is the computational complexity of fact1? Explain your answer.
def fact1(i):
 assert type(i) == int and i >= 0
 res = 1
 while i > 1:
    res = res * i
    i -= 1
 return res

Ans: O(n)


3) What is the computational complexity of makeSet? Explain your answer.
def makeSet(s):
 assert type(s) == str
 res = ''
 for c in s:
    if not c in res:
        res = res + c
 return res 

Ans: O(n)

4) What is the computational complexity of intersect? Explain your answer.
def intersect(s1, s2):
 assert type(s1) == str and type(s2) == str
 s1 = makeSet(s1)
 s2 = makeSet(s2)
 res = ''
 for e in s1:
    if e in s2:
        res = res + e
 return res 

Ans: O(len(s1) * len(s2) =~ O(n ** 2)


5) Present a hand simulation of the code below. Describe the value to which each
identifier is bound after each step of the computation. Note that “s1” and “s2” exist
in more than one scope.
def swap0(s1, s2):
 assert type(s1) == list and type(s2) == list
 tmp = s1[:]
 s1 = s2[:]
 s2 = tmp
 return
s1 = [1]
s2 = [2]
swap0(s1, s2)
print s1, s2 

Ans: [2][1]

6) Present a hand simulation of the following code:
def swap1(s1, s2):
 assert type(s1) == list and type(s2) == list
 return s2, s1
s1 = [1]
s2 = [2]
s1, s2 = swap1(s1, s2)
print s1, s2 

Ans: [2][1]

7) Present a hand simulation of the following code:
def rev(s):
 assert type(s) == list
 for i in range(len(s)/2):
    tmp = s[i]
    s[i] = s[-(i+1)]
    s[-(i+1)] = tmp
s = [1,2,3]
rev(s)
print s

Ans: [3,2,1]
